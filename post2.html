                        <p>Habit can be defined as something that you do often and regularly, a usual way of behaving. It sometimes can be considered bad action that someone does repeatedly and finds it difficult to stop doing which could also become subconscious. </p>
                        <p>Addiction (according to Merriam Webster Dictionary) can be defined as a compulsive, chronic, psychological need for a habit-forming substance, behavior, or activity having harmful physical, psychological, or social effects.</p>
                        <p>However, the issue of addictions and bad habits is that it comes to a point where you don’t have control over your actions. Most persons who have issues with addictions have tried to overcome it, some have even made vows and taken oats that they want to turn a new leaf, but however they find themselves back at it again. Nevertheless, there could be a way out to freedom.</p>
                        <p>Here are some steps to help overcome bad habits and addictions:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify the issues: this is to say, you have to identify the bad habits and actions that one constantly repeats and indulges in.</li>
                            <li>Set realistic goals: you have to set realistic goals which are achievable. One big problem is that people set goals that are most times difficult to achieve. Set achievable goals and gradually follow the process. This starts by shaping your everyday activities and how you feel about yourself. Set appropriate steps to achieving your goals. Because breaking a bad habit and addiction takes longer than forming a new one.</li>
                            <li>Discipline: Commit yourself to achieving your goals, because without discipline you will not be able to overcome habits not serving you.</li>
                            <li>“Flee from Temptation”: you contribute to your addiction or bad habits when you put yourself in a familiar position where your triggers are present. Avoid triggers that might set you backward. Staying away from temptation consciously is a lot easier than you think. Don’t hang around people that encourage those habits and addictions. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will advise, admonish and help you in achieving your goals.</li>
                            <li>Find a Mentor: telling someone you can trust about those bad habits and addictions is a sign that you are willing to be free. Consider telling a trusted friend, Parent, Mentor, Clergyman or join support groups. They can encourage you in times of doubt and gently remind you of your goals if they notice you backsliding into old habits.</li>
                            <li>Meditation and Prayer: it is important to pray or meditate as the case may be. Irrespective of religion meditating on the holy book as God’s word has the capacity to change any man.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Finally, Most times, it is not about what you are abstaining from, but what you are feeding your mind with. In reference to the bible Romans 7 vs 14-15, Paul said he finds himself doing the thigs he does not want to do and this is the experience with many. Feed on positive things and mentally prepare for slip ups so you don’t feel guilty or discouraged if you do.  Remember that changes in bad habits may not be sudden, you may not see the changes immediately but sooner or later you will find out that it is all in the past.</p>

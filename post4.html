                        <p>A woman is a female human being. They are one of the most powerful gifts given to mother earth by the creator (Personal Communication). According to Ogunjemilua and Familugba (2015), women are the fundamental human reservoir of every society as they control most of the non-monetary economy (subsistence, agriculture, bearing children, domestic labour, etc.). The women, right from the foundation of the world have been sharing half the sky with the men, yet they have been considered inferior to men.</p>
                        <p>Women have a basic human right to be educated and this right has been recognized since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Educating women develops growth rates and reduces social disparities. In 2009, the Nigerian Population Council (NPC) observed that women with higher educational qualifications are more likely to be in formal wage employment than those at the level of primary school education.</p>
                        <p>Women in Nigeria have had various challenges in order to obtain equal education in all forms of education in Nigeria, they have also contributed in the welfare and growth of the country amidst of these challenges. Therefore, they cannot be neglected in sharing their active participation in education.</p>
                        <p>Education has been considered as panacea for all sort of social issues and for peaceful living. However, in Nigeria, due to some cultural and religious beliefs etc. many people especially women and children are being denied access to quality education. The following are issues plaguing women access to education just to name a few:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Culture, Tradition and Religious Belief: According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view is that it is better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place is believed to be the kitchen. The Nigerian society (both historical and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural practices that are potently hurtful to women's emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices.</li>
                            <li>Cost of Education: there is an increasing cost of education, mainly because of the economic downturn and hardship, as a result there are low enrolments. Parents can hardly send their kids to school and are usually forced to send their kids to hawk or learn trades.</li>
                            <li>Poor Economy: The decline in economic activities since the early 1980s has made education a luxury to many Nigerians, especially those in rural areas. Often the family can only afford to send one child to school or none in some cases.</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Presently, Nigeria as a nation is going through a lot of challenges, arising from political, economic, social and cultural issues. Education helps men and women claim their rights and realize their potential in economic, political cultural and social arenas</p>
                        <p>The <b><i>benefits</i></b> of female education to society have multiple effects such as:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bridging gender disparity by ensuring equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, this will build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger.</li>
                            <li>Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children's nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished.</li>
                            <li>Increase in standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being.</li>
                            <li>Increased workforce availability ensures that a country will have an expanse of human capital at its disposal, this in turn will expand a Countries economic growth and prevent gender-based discrimination against women and girls that remains prevalent in our society.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Finally, reducing women illiteracy in Nigeria, will in turn increase women Political, Social and Economic participation. Below are ways women participation and education can improve:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Access to specific educational information, programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning.</li>
                            <li>Increasing female participation in leadership positions of what seems like male dominated professions.</li>
                            <li>Women should also be given increased opportunities to participate actively in Sports and recreational activities.</li>
                            <li>Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, nationally or internationally. For instance the United Nation General Assembly in 1979 adopted The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations.</li>

                        <p>Families are the basic building block of a society, and it is made up of Parents (Adults) and Children. Parents have the responsibility of ensuring that children grow up in the right environment to be well adjusted and functional adults in the society.</p>
                        <p>However the protection of a child irrespective of gender have become imperative, as increased cases of sexual harassment and molestation even at tender age have become rampant. Listed below are the causes of this increased child molestation: </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Parental Negligence:</b> I think parents today are so preoccupied with making a living that they often neglect their kids, they are no longer present and observant of changes in their kids’ mood and behaviours. This can be traced to other factors such as:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Poverty and economic challenges plaguing the average family, as parents now have to work more hours to fend for their family at the expense of staying home and catering for their kids.</li>
                                    <li>More working class women makes it hard for at least one parental figure to be more present in children's daily life unlike in decades past. </li>
                                    <li>Knowingly or unknowingly exposing kids to adult contents and behaviours.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li><b>Over Pampering:</b> Kids who come from a family of means are often over pampered and the duty of caretaking is left for strangers who may have malicious intentions.</li>
                            <li><b>Moral Decadence:</b> The level of societal decadence and lack of morals is so prevalent especially among those who are supposed to keep up moral codes. Parents and adults alike no longer care to ensure good morals in their daily living, society is littered with activities of impunity.</li>
                            <li><b>Role of Media:</b> Various harmful propaganda from various media sources (Television, radio, print media), have contributed to child sexual molestation, as most information, adverts, movies, etc. are filled with highly provocative and sexualized contents.</li>
                            <li><b>Internet and Social Media:</b> The internet despite its many advantages has also been a breeding ground for ‘not so good contents’. The increased access to internet has also led to rise in Child pornography and related issues. Not to forget the unrestricted access of kids to social media and undue exposure to profanities.</li>
                            <li><b>Female Genital Mutilation:</b> This is kind of a sensitive issue and also a cultural issue but it’s essential to do away with archaic practices that can scar girls/women for life.</li>
                            <li><b>Under Age Marriage:</b> This could happen as a result of cultural, religious and economic factors </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT THE ABOVE</h3>
                        <p>The rate at which issues of child molestation have risen should give one nightmares, the question now is what can be done to mitigate these issues. A few ideas come to mind:</p>
                        <p>As earlier stated, parents and Adults should always show acute awareness of the activities of children, and wards.</p>
                        <p>Parents should ensure Proper regulation and guidance of children's access to the internet, social media and other forms of media.</p>
                        <p>Activities of NGOs and civil societies in raising awareness on the prevention of boy & girl child molestation cannot be over emphasized.</p>
                        <p>Finally stricter government legislation can be passed to help prevent child sexual molestation.</p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <p><b>NOTE:</b> The above can also be applicable to any Child irrespective of gender.</p>
